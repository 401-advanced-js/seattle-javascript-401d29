How to Solve Programming Problems by John Sonmez

When tasked with a programming interview problem, the would obviously be a lot of pressure to showcase your best. Unfortunately, one of the most common mistakes for interviewees is to do the problem as fast as they can and get right to coding to show effieciency, which in all actuality shows the opposite.

Rather, the thought process one should follow during the interview question, as described in How to Solve Programming Problems by John Sonmez, would mimic a style central to the planning phase of a problem. Sonmez claims that most interviewees should focus more on their understanding of the problem and the completeness of that understanding over the speed at which one solves said problem. With statistics of “70% of our time should be spent” in developing an well thought out algorithm, which excludes any form of hands on keyboard (Sonmez).

 

Somnez’s steps in one outline:

1.       Read the problem twice (or more)

a.       To gather a deep understanding of the problem

                                                               i.      Lack in understanding means you can’t solve it

b.       A good test is to explain the problem back

c.       Examples can help with understanding, utilize your ability to ask questions if no examples are given or you don’t understand an example

2.       Solve the problem manually

a.       Come up with an algorithm

                                                               i.      DO NOT just write random code that you think works (If it wasn’t obvious)

b.       Build the algorithm for different inputs

c.       Break down your thought process to be aware of each step

3.       Optomize the manual steps

a.       Anything that can be optimized through a loop, or really anything that shortens down the amount of manual code you wrote in the previous step, do that

4.       Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo code

a.       Sonmez claimed this step to be more of a optional one assuming your first three steps were throughouly done with confidence.

b.       If you’re not confident in translating manual steps to real code, then this step is writing down the structure of your code in words you and the interviewer understand based off your manual code

5.       Replace step 4 with actual code

a.       The translation step where the code is actually written

                                                               i.      If there is any confusion about structure now, then the previous steps weren’t done througough enough.

                                                             ii.      Or you don’t know the language well enough to perform the code you methodically planned out up to this point

1.       Somnez goes into a further breakdown of common concepts interview questions revolve around

a.       Create a list

b.       Sort a list or array

c.       Loop through a list or dictionary

d.       Parse strings

e.       Convert from string to int, int to string, etc

6.       Optomize code from 5

a.       Reflection step on the masterpiece you created with the interviewer

b.       Simply as much as you can for cleaner code

c.       Naming conventions
