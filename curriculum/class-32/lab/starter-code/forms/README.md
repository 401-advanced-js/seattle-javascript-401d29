# Lab32 By Spencer Hirata

[Code Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/24rl4oo07p)
[PR](https://github.com/401-advanced-js/seattle-javascript-401d29/pull/3)

### Testing

No tests are currently formed, here is what I would test:

All functionality Tests

- Each of the players-actions methods
- Each of the players-reducer methods
- State is changed on each CRUD operator

No input tests (assuming most of the schema deals with requiring fields)

---

Here is what my code ended up at:

- It can go to a url

  - Translate the schema to a form
  - Make each input field a requirement

- It can Create an entry based on the form fields
- It can delete any entry with the button on the side of the entry
- It can change the currently selected (active player) with a get button
