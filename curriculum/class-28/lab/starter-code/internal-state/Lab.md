### Assignment 2 - Internal State Practice

Begin with: `/lab/starter-code/internal-state`

**Challenge Instructions (Part 1)**

- Leave these instructions in place
- Fork this sandbox
- Complete all tasks in this same index.js file
- Complete the challenge below and submit the URL to your fork
- Add a constructor and declare a state object
- "state" should have "count" and "name" properties
- Add a form with a single field
- As the user types in the field, change the "name" property in state and update the display
- When the user "submits" the form, increase the counter by 1 and update the display
- The output section below should update as state changes

**Challenge Instructions (Part 2)**

- Fork your completed sandbox
- Refactor your work using new modules for each component
- Be prepared to discuss/defend file & directory structures chosen

**Stretch Goals / Further Practice**

- Instead of updating the count on submit, create a link that updates the count on demand
- Use multiple fields in your form to update multiple state properties
- Make evaluations on the state of your state to dynamically render things. For example, if the name is empty, show an error or if there are 2 names given (first and last), reverse and comma separate them.
