### Finished features

Form is populated from the superagent request to the heroku deployment

### Unfinished features

- On your first pull from the server of the database records, save them in the store for faster retrieval
- Instead of saving straight to the Redux Store, use an async action creator function to send data to the server (using post or put) and then update the local store
- When rendering the forms and lists, use the store as a cache, and update it after you save to the server.
- tests that ensure the list module functions correctly with error-check parameters
- Style it!
